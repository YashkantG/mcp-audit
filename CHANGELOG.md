# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) — plus
the additional rule-stability guarantees below, which matter if you pin rule
IDs in CI.

## Rule stability policy

Teams pin things like `--ignore-rule MCP004` and `--fail-on high` in their
pipelines, so rule identity is part of the public API, not an implementation
detail:

- **Rule IDs are never reused or renumbered.** If a rule is retired, its ID is
  retired with it.
- **A rule's default severity will not change in a patch release.** Severity
  changes ship in a minor release at the earliest, and are always listed here.
- **New rules may be added in a minor release.** This can surface new findings
  in an existing codebase, which is why `--fail-on`, `--ignore-rule` and
  `.mcptriage.toml` exist. (A baseline mode, to accept existing findings and
  fail only on new ones, is planned but not yet implemented.)
- **Removing a rule, or making an existing rule meaningfully broader, is a
  breaking change** and waits for a major version.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-06

### Renamed
- **The project is now `mcp-triage`** (was `mcp-sentinel`, briefly `mcp-audit`).
  "Sentinel" collided with Microsoft Sentinel, which had just shipped its own
  MCP server; "audit" was rejected by PyPI as too similar to the existing
  `mcpaudit`. Rule IDs are unchanged and remain the stable public API.
- Config file is `.mcptriage.toml`; suppression comments are
  `# mcp-triage: ignore[MCP102]`.

### Added
- **`--format badge`** — emits a shields.io endpoint payload a project can
  commit and display, showing an A–F posture grade.
- **`--include-tests`** — opts test/example/benchmark directories back into a
  scan (they are skipped by default, see below).
- **GitHub Pages site** at https://yashkantg.github.io/mcp-triage/.
- **`research/ecosystem_scan.py`** — reproducible survey harness for the public
  MCP server ecosystem, plus the results it produced in the README.

### Changed — detection accuracy
Surveying 141 public MCP servers exposed three classes of false positive, all
now fixed and covered by regression tests:

- **Test, fixture, example, benchmark and mock directories are skipped by
  default.** Most raw findings came from fake credentials in redaction tests
  and deliberately-unsafe example snippets. `vendor/` and `third_party/` are
  never scanned.
- **The secrets check recognises mock/placeholder values** (`local-mock-key`,
  `dummy-token`, ...). Cut MCP201 findings by 85% across the survey.
- **`MCP101`/`MCP102` no longer match `pattern.exec(line)`** — the ordinary
  JavaScript RegExp API, which accounted for **77%** of all code-execution
  findings. Now requires a bare call or an explicit `child_process` member.
- **A JSON object needs more than a `description` field to count as a tool.**
  npm manifests and OpenAPI documents were being scanned as tool definitions.

### Changed — MCP001
- **Prompt-injection detection now covers real tool poisoning**, not just
  literal "ignore previous instructions": pseudo-tag payloads
  (`<IMPORTANT>`, `<instructions>`), notes addressed to the assistant,
  read-a-sensitive-path-and-return-it-via-parameter, and tool shadowing. Half
  the new tests are negative cases — ordinary documentation must stay clean.

  Worth stating plainly: across 141 surveyed repositories, MCP001 fired **once**
  under the old patterns. Deliberate tool poisoning is rare in public code.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-05

### Added
- **SARIF 2.1.0 output** (`--format sarif`), validated against the official
  schema — findings can be uploaded to GitHub Code Scanning, GitLab, or any
  SARIF-consuming dashboard.
- **Badge output** (`--format badge`) producing a shields.io endpoint payload,
  so a scanned project can display its own posture grade.
- **Inline suppression comments**: `# mcp-triage: ignore[MCP102]` suppresses
  a specific rule on that line; a bare `# mcp-triage: ignore` suppresses all.
- **Project configuration** via `.mcptriage.toml`: repo-wide rule and path
  ignores, per-rule severity overrides, and `[[custom_rules]]` for
  organisation-specific checks without forking.
- `--ignore-rule` (repeatable) and `--config` CLI options.
- **GitHub Action** (`action.yml`) with an `upload-sarif` path straight into
  Code Scanning.
- **pre-commit hook** definition (`.pre-commit-hooks.yaml`).
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, issue forms, and a pull request template.

### Fixed
- `__version__` was still reporting `0.1.0` after the 0.2.0 release.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-05

### Added
- Tool descriptions are now extracted from **source code** (JS/TS/Python string
  literals, including `+`-concatenated multi-line strings), not just static
  JSON manifests. This was the flagship prompt-injection check's biggest blind
  spot: scanning the official `modelcontextprotocol/servers` reference
  implementations produced zero findings before this, because none of them ship
  a static manifest.

### Fixed
- False positive where the MCP004 broad-capability check matched `exec` as a
  substring of ordinary words like "executes". Keyword matching is now
  word-boundary aware.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added
- Initial release: 11 rules across tool-description analysis (prompt injection,
  hidden unicode, over-broad capability, unvalidated schemas), dangerous code
  sinks, hardcoded secrets, and unsafe server defaults.
- `table` and `json` output, `--fail-on` severity gating for CI.
